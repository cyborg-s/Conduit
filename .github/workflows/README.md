## Description

  The workflow is triggered when you push to the branch, which defined in [Deployment.yml](./deployment.yml)

The CD pipline has two jobs:
    
   1. Build task: This task creates a Docker container image within GitHub Actions to outsource this task. 
   2. Deploy task: This job transfers the deployment files to the target server and starts the Conduit application using Docker Compose.
